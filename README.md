//confetti-cuisine is the The application code this application found in our primary textbook, Get Programming with Node.js, as the Capstone 
project found in Lesson 37 in Unit 8 in the 'finish' folder. 
//The main purpose of  semester's final project is to use this program as a starting point and modify/improve it in a variety of ways.
In this confetti cuisine we have expanded site's capabilities to include "cuisine-based culinary vacations" which revolve around learning to cook various food styles 
by vacationing while attending cooking classes hosted by well-known local chefs, both in the US and abroad.
//client interface for these new offerings should look like and function pretty much exactly like the current setup for the local course offerings 
which already exist. There should be a parallel set of vacation package views, routes, API endpoints, and a Mongoose schema model just as with the local courses.
